# Pyspark tasks:

1. Read the json data from the data file using a predefined schema (don't rely on pyspark capabilities to read the data, define your own schema) 
2. Parse the balance field and create a new column that holds the numeric value of the field
3. Create a new dataframe that holds the sum of balance field by gender
4. Create a new repo and put the Jupyter notebook with corresponding pyspark commands inside there. Share the link to the repo afterwards
